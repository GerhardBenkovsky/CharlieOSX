# CharlieOSX

CharlieOSX is the best choice as a program for your specific robot.
Just fill in your robot Parameters in the config.py file and everything else like driving and robot handling is set up automatically.

#### What you can already do:
- Steer a NORMAL type Robot with gearing via [number codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmdYeWCkykAH5O6e8qv4fGR5aR4e66AjW1zxPTqASJo/edit?usp=sharing)
- partial control for ALLWHEEL robot Type with number codes

#### What you will be able to do:
- Control your robot, no matter how it is constructed and driven through the number codes
- insert/edit the number codes on the brick itself
- create a map with barriers and let the robot navigate on it's own
- steer the robot with a remote control of some kind (actually not sure what kind), save the steered path and let it repeat it
- use a FLL mode with separate program slots according to the Tasks on the Field and an extra mode for executing them in a specific order at the competition itself
