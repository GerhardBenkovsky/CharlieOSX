# CharlieOSX
*By XilefTech from the "Lego Spirits"*

CharlieOSX is the best choice as a program for your specific robot.
Just fill in your robot Parameters in the config.py file and everything else like driving and robot handling is set up automatically.


### How to use CharlieOSX with your robot:
*(assuming you already installed The Pybricks OS on the brick and the extension in VS code)*
1. Download and open this project in VS code
2. Open the config.py file and fill in everything that is needed about your robot
3. You can now add as many execute() functions as you like to the end of the main.py file with an array with the number codes. *Note: you can add multiple commands directly after each other in the array and the robot will drive them all*
4. Just download and the robot will execute your instructions


#### What you can already do:
- Steering any of the three Robot types with the Help of the [number codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmdYeWCkykAH5O6e8qv4fGR5aR4e66AjW1zxPTqASJo/edit?usp=sharing)

#### What you will be able to do:
- insert/edit the number codes on the brick itself
- create a map with barriers and let the robot navigate on it's own
- steer the robot with a remote control of some kind (actually not sure what kind), save the steered path and let it repeat it
- use a FLL mode with separate program slots according to the Tasks on the Field and an extra mode for executing them in a specific order at the competition itself
